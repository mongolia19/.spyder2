== Tips ==
*Always use over-ripe bananas, they provide the most flavor.  Bananas that are over-ripe has dark almost black-colored peel is the best to use for banana bread recipes.
*Room temperature butter will blend better with ingredients.
*4-5 mashed bananas will equal the amount necessary for a cup of mashed bananas.
*Use large eggs if possible.
*Stick a toothpick in the cake at 25 minutes; if the toothpick comes out dry, then the cake is done.

== Warnings ==
*Over mixing will result in the cake not rising.
*If the flour and milk mixture isn't stirred constantly, it will get lumpy very quickly.
*Icing the cake while the cake is warm will cause the icing to run or cause the cake to fall apart.
