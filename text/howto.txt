== Tips ==
* Use half or double the amount of ingredients for a smaller or larger cake, respectively.
* Don't cut the cake or even try to remove it from the baking pan unless it has been cooled for minimum of 5 minutes. Preferably, leave it to cool completely. Only cut or try to remove it from the baking pan before it is completely if there is a big issue with time or if your cake is supposed to be served warm.
*Try baking the cake at a slightly lower temperature to make it light and spongy. You will need to cook it a little longer, though.
* Consider adding some edible decorations like chocolate chips, cream flowers or beads, etc.
* If you want a softer cake, add more baking powder.
* Some people are vegetarians and do not eat eggs, so you will need to prepare Eggless cakes for them. Many people even don’t like having sour cream or butter. So what you can do is have some substitutes in place of the eggs like rice flour. However if you use rice flour, be prepared for the cake batter to remain thin.
* You can use milk instead of water.
* Want to know if your cake is baked? Put a toothpick in the center.
