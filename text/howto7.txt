{{fa}}Black beans are a perfect substitute for the meat in a hamburger recipe because they're high in protein and have a great consistency for mashing together into patties. They also have an added benefit of being high in fiber and low in fat, which makes them both very nutritious and vegan friendly.

== Tips ==
*To avoid transferring the heat from the pepper onto your hands, try rubbing a little oil onto your fingertips before seeding the pepper. You can also wear rubber or latex gloves if you're very sensitive to the spiciness of the peppers.
*If you don't have a fresh hot pepper, you can use one dried hot pepper (crushed) or 1 to 2 teaspoons of crushed hot pepper flakes.
*Make sure to stir the mixture regularly when saut¨¦ing the vegetables, since the garlic can burn easily in the hot oil; burned garlic gives off a bitter flavor that can ruin the dish.
*Instead of making 5 large patties, you can make 10 smaller burgers out of this recipe to assemble into sliders and serve as appetizers.
*If you like your burgers extra spicy, skip the seeding step and add all the seeds from the hot pepper into the recipe.

== Warnings ==
*All 5 patties may not fit into your pan all at once, so you might have to fry them in smaller batches.

== Things You'll Need ==
*Chopping board
*Sharp knife
*Plate
*Saut¨¦ pan
*Wooden spoon
*Medium bowl
*Potato masher or fork
