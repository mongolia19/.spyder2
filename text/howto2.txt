#Open a can of tuna. Drain the water or oil packaged with it. Dump the tuna into a bowl. If the tuna is chunked, break it apart with a fork or your hands.{{largeimage|Make a Tuna Patty Sandwich Step 1.jpg}}

#Crush five saltine crackers and add it into the bowl. Be careful not to crush them into powder. You still want a few chunks.{{largeimage|Make a Tuna Patty Sandwich Step 3.jpg}}
#Add seasoning. Pepper, garlic, chili powder, and cumin are all good seasonings. Experiment with whatever other seasonings you like. Mostly seasonings that have a zest to them are best.<br><br>
#*Add Worcestershire sauce. It gives it a good flavor. You want to cover the tuna in it. Add more or less to personal preference. Adding hot sauce also gives it a spicy flavor. Not to much though. Lemon juice also gives it tasty zest. Adding to much liquids will make it runny.{{largeimage|Make a Tuna Patty Sandwich Step 4Bullet1.jpg}}
