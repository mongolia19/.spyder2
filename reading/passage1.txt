How to Be a Winner
　　Sir Steven Redgrave
　　Winner of 5 Olympic Gold Medals
　　In 1997 I was found to have developed diabetes. Believing my career was over, I felt extremely low. Then one of the specialists said there was to no reason why I should stop training and competing. That was it -the encouragement I needed. I could still be a winner if I believed in myself. I am not saying that it isn¨t difficult sometimes. But I wanted to prove to myself that I wasn't finished yet. Nothing is to stand in my way.

　　Swimming World Champion
 I swim 4 hours a day, 6 days a week. I manage that sort of workload by putting it on top of my diary. This is the key to success-you can¨t follow a career in any field without being well-organized. List what you believe you can achieve. Trust yourself, write down your goals for the day, however small they are, and you¨ll be a step closer to achieving them.

When things are getting hard, a voice inside my head tells me that I can¨t achieve something. Then, there are other distractions, such as family or hobbies. The key is to concentrate. When I feel tense, it helps a lot to repeat words such as calm, peace or focus, either out loud or silently in my mind. It makes me feel more in control and increases my confidence. This is a habit that can become second nature quite easily and is a powerful psychological tool
